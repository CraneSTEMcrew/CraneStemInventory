                  All safety and disease mitigation guidelines set forth by your district or
                  organization should be applied when integrating equipment into classroom lesson
                  plans. For most districts and organizations, these precautions include but are not
                  limited to: social distancing, disinfection of materials between student use, use
                  of proper personal protective equipment, frequent student handwashing, and the use
                  of hand sanitizer. Please refer to school district guidelines and confer with your
                  building administrator(s) for guidance before checking out and using materials.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Teachers/school should provide for their own equipment cleaning supplies to
                  properly disinfect materials between individual student uses. Some exceptions to
                  this policy are in place for materials that require specific cleaning protocols.
                  For example, alcohol swabs will be provided to sanitize microscopes. Appropriate
                  cleaning directions for all equipment will be provided to patrons. These
                  instructions will be included in the reservation confirmation email. Please do not
                  disinfect any materials until you have familiarized yourself with this
                  information.
                </li>
                <li>Equipment will continue to be loaned out in two-week increments.</li>
                <li>
                  To reserve materials, patrons must create an account at
                  cranelendinglibrary.myturn.com (our new website) or complete a patron form and an
                  account will be created for you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Materials are not to be shared between multiple patrons within the same building
                  or with other facilities without authorization.

                  If you are in possession of Lending Library materials and your school building or
                  facility closes due to COVID-19, please contact the NSWC STEM team promptly to
                  arrange for immediate pick-up.
